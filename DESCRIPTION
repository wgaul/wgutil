Description: Assorted functions to do things that I commonly do in analyzing 
    ecological data. Some of these functions are specifically for working with 
    data recorded at the hectad or 1km block scale.  Some functions in this 
    package are drawn directly from other people's work, including from Cookbook
    for R by Winston Chang.
